/*
The elves are playing with a magical train ðŸš‚ that carries gifts. This train moves on a board represented by an array of strings.

The train consists of an engine (@), followed by its carriages (o), and must collect magical fruits (*) which serve as fuel. The movement of the train follows these rules:

You will receive two parameters board and mov.

board is an array of strings that represents the board:

@ is the train's engine.
o are the train's carriages.
* is a magical fruit.
Â· are empty spaces.
mov is a string that indicates the next movement of the train from the train's head @:

'L': left
'R': right
'U': up
'D': down.
With this information, you must return a string:

'crash': If the train crashes into the edges of the board or itself.
'eat': If the train collects a magical fruit (*).
'none': If it moves without crashing or collecting any magical fruit.
