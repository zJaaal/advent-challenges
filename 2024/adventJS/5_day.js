/*
Santa Claus's elves üßùüßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è have found a bunch of mismatched magic boots in the workshop.
Each boot is described by two values:

type indicates if it's a left boot (I) or a right boot (R).
size indicates the size of the boot.

Your task is to help the elves pair all the boots of the same size having a left and a right one.
To do this, you should return a list of the available sizes after pairing the boots.
